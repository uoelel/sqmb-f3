# SQMB 2022/23 â€“ Formative Assessment 3

**DEADLINE: THURSDAY 6 APRIL AT NOON**

In this assessment, you'll be given a data set and a research question, and it'll be up to you how best to analyse the data to address the question.
(The second summative assessment will have a similar format, so this is your chance to practice and get feedback before embarking upon the summative!)

As always, you'll find more detailed instructions in the file `code/analysis.Rmd`.


## To submit your work

When you are satisfied, you can **submit your project** by:

1. rendering your Rmd file to PDF, and
2. uploading it to Turnitin via Learn. You can find the link under Assessment > Formative Assessment F3.
